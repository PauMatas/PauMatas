### Hi there 🫡 Welcome to my Github profile!

I’m currently working as ML Engineer at [Smadex](https://smadex.com).   
We’re an adtech company building AI models to optimize how much advertisers bid in digital ad auctions.

I studied at [UPC](https://www.upc.edu/ca) and I have previously worked on:
* Software for Vehicle Perception at [BCNeMotorsport](https://bcnemotorsport.upc.edu/home/) (10 months).
* Started [datastudents](https://x.com/datastudents), there we organized [Datathon FME](https://www.datathon.cat/) and built [ApuntsDades](https://apuntsdades.com/inicia-sessio) (2.5 years).
* End-to-end NLP Client-Oriented projects at [Vinces](https://www.vincesconsulting.com/ca/) (1y 5 months).
